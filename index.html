         <p>
            I'm a system administration student living in Murcia, Spain. 
            <br>Currently, I know html and css, also a little bit of javascript, php and sql and I'm working to improve these skills.
            <br><br>I still have a lot to learn about web development, but I always try to get the best out of every job I do.
            <br>I love creating new projects and spend my time researching, designing and coding.
            <br><br>When I'm not working I like playing video games, go to the gym, listen to music and try to learn new interesting things.
         </p>

         <p>
            Before an idea becomes reality, it has to make sense. I try to think about customer requirements and user needs first, the two essential ingredients for a successful project.
            <br><br><span>First Contact</span>
            <br>At a first meeting, I like setting out the objectives and scope of the project, as well as the possible deadlines and budget. I also usually explain an example of how I do my job, if necessary I schedule additional meetings.
            <br><br><span>Planning</span>
            <br>Once the scope of the project has been approved, I draw up a possible roadmap. First, I bring all the ideas to light and put them in writing. Second, defining the possible technologies to be used. And finally, taking into account the possible problems and their solutions before starting the project.
            <br><br><span>Design, Prototype & Build</span>
            <br>To create a good design, I need to understand its content and create a value around it. After understanding this, I start the creation process, where I create possible designs that I review with the client. When the client gives the approval, I start with the construction but without forgetting the client, giving him the opportunity to continue contributing.
            <br><br><span>Handover, Launch and Ongoing support</span>
            <br>Once the project is completed, all files will be delivered for operation, and if necessary I will write any help documentation. In addition the client can always contact me in case any problems arise or need help.

         <p>Sometimes I design ideas that come to my mind or take the opportunity to work with other people, this is my way to improve and earn experience.</p>
